# Day-1 Task: Java Console Calculator

## Objective:
I created a simple calculator using Java that takes input from the console and performs basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

## Tools Used:
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code
- Command Prompt(Terminal)

## Features:
- Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
- Shows an error if division by zero is attempted.

## Files Included:
- Calculator.java (Java source code)
- Screenshot of Output 

## Steps I Followed:
1. First, I created separate methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. I used the Scanner class to take input from the user.
3. I used a while loop to repeat the calculations until the user wants to exit.
4. I added a check to handle division by zero and display an error message.
5. After each operation, the result is shown, and the user is asked if they want to continue or exit.

## Outcome:
Through this task, I learned how to:
- Work with user input using Scanner.
- Write and call methods for different operations.
- Handle invalid cases like division by zero.
- Implement looping and switch-case in a real-time program.
It helped me understand Java syntax, logic building, and console interaction.
